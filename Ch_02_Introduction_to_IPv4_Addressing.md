# 2.0 Introduction to IPv4 Addressing

## 2.1 IPv4 Addressing
    IP Addressing Overview
    - Most of the devices on the Internet communicate to each other using a Protocol called the Internet Protocol (IP). Most of the Internet is running Version 4 of the IP 
      Protocol.
    - Every device on the Internet has to be identified uniquely on the Internet. This is done by assigning each device an Address. 
    - This Address is called the IPv4 address or an IP Address.
    - An IP address is a 32-bit number written in dotted decimal notation. [199.87.20.5]. 
    - Each digit is a 8-bit value separated by a “ . ”. This 8-bit block is known as an Octet.
    - The IP address has 4 Octets.
    - The total size of an IP Address is 32 Bits. 
    
    Binary & Decimal Numbering Systems
    - Although the IP address is written in decimal, the devices process it in the Binary System.
    - We have 8 bits in each Octet. 
    - It is important to understand the conversion between Binary and Decimal within the Octet.
    - The following table helps in the conversion. 
    - In this table, the value represents the bit value of the corresponding bit in the IP Address.
