# 1. Introduction to Networking

## 1.1 Introduction to Networks
    What is Network?
    The connection between two or more than two devices, nodes or points whether the link is wired or wireless
    is known to be a Network.


    Prior to Networking
    - Initial computer systems were Standalone devices.
    - All the resources would be directly connected to each devices.
    - The main resources that were used by the initial PCâ€™s were Printers, Storage (Hard Drives), Scanners etc.
    - This led to loss of productivity in the company.
    - If a user had to print a document, he would need to copy the file to a removable media (Floppy Disks), move to the PC that was
      connected to the Printer, open the file from the Floppy and print it.
    - This is where network helped by connecting the devices (Computers, Printers etc.) to each other so that these resources could
      be shared with each other.

    
    Goal of Networking
    - Shared hardware such as printers and input devices
    - Shared data and information through the use of shared storage devices
    - Communications such as email, instant messaging, chat rooms, etc.
    - Shared software, which is achieved by running applications on remote computers (Google GSuites, Microsoft office 365, Dropbox, GMail)

    wired Network - Cables consist of Coaxial, UTP, STP, Fibre Optics . Centralized devices will be Switch or Hub. Nowadays, Switch is preferred.
   
    Wireless Network - Radio waves or frequency. It uses Wireless Access Point device (equivalent to Switch in wireless networking).

    Hybrid Network - uses both wired and wireless devices. The Wireless Access Point Connects to the Switch using a Cable.
            The access point acts as a connection bridge between a wired and a wireless network.

    NIC - network interface card. Wi-Fi connections use wireless NICs (WLAN). Ethernet is the most popular wired LAN technology.
    RG-58 - Coaxial Cable connectore. BNC connector for RG58 cable. (Bayonet Neil-Concelman, or sometimes British Naval Connector) connector 
    RJ-45 - Registered Jack 45.
    T-connector - Tee Connector. used to split radio frequency power from a cable into two

    HUB -
    Switch -

## 1.2 Network Types
    PAN - Personal Area Network
    LAN -  Local Area Network
    MAN - Metropolitan Area Network
    WAN (Private) - Wide Area Network
    WAN (Public) Internet -
    

    Switch - Connects devices in the same network.
    Router - Connects devices of different network.

## 1.3 Network Devices
